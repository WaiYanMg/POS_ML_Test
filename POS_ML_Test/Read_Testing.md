Project IDea

A next-generation POS reporting platform enhanced with machine learning (ML.NET) and LangChain AI to predict business trends, generate intelligent insights, and assist users through conversational analytics.

Currently developing modules for AI-driven sales forecasting, financial reports, and claim form analysis. Early prototypes include ML.NET model testing and LangChain AI experiments that interpret POS data, calculate performance results, and notify users intelligently.

Future updates will introduce a chatbot and voice interaction system for real-time business reporting and decision support.
